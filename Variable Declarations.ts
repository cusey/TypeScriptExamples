const declarations
They are like let declarations but, as their name implies, their value cannot be changed once they are bound.
In other words, they have the same scoping rules as let, but you canâ€™t re-assign to them.

Block-scoping
When a variable is declared using let, it uses what some call lexical-scoping or block-scoping. Unlike variables
declared with var whose scopes leak out to their containing function, block-scoped variables are not visible outside 
of their nearest containing block or for-loop.
